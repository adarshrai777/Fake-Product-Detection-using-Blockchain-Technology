Over the last few years, Counterfeit products play an important role in product manufacturing industries. This affects the companyâ€™s name, sales, and profit of the companies. Blockchain technology is used for identification of real products and detects fake products.

Blockchain technology is the distributed, decentralized, and digital ledger that stores transactional information in the form of blocks in databases which are connected with the chains. Blockchain technology is a secure technology therefore any block cannot be changed or hacked. By using Blockchain technology, customers or users do not need to rely on third-party users for the confirmation of product safety.
In this project, with increasing trends in mobile and wireless technology, Quick Response (QR) codes provide a robust technique to fight the practice of counterfeiting the products. Counterfeit products are detected using a QR code scanner, where a QR code of the product is linked to a Blockchain. So, this system may be used to store product details and generate unique code of that product as blocks in the database. It collects the unique code from the user and compares the code against entries in the Blockchain database. If the code matches, it will give a notification to the customer, otherwise it will give the notification to the customer that the product is fake.


FUTURE SCOPE

The unpredictability of distributed system code directly affects the overall cost of running a distributed system. 
Ethereum blockchain. Future use of this system may prove how simple the code is as it is distributed with a simple application design and no redundant code, customers can be confident that their consumption will not increase as a result.
